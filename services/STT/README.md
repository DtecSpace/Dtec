# STT Services
The two models for speech-to-text services are an online service and an offline service. The online service uses an API that is powered by advanced research and technology to accurately convert speech to text. On the other hand, the offline service has a low word error rate for the Turkish language and is capable of translating multiple languages. Additionally, it utilizes a noise-canceling service that helps to improve the quality of the transcription results. Overall, both services offer distinct features and benefits for converting speech to text, and can be selected based on specific needs and preferences.
